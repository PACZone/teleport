Teleport; Bridge your PAC coin to any other Chain

# What is Teleport?

The Teleport Protocol is a bridge from [Pactus](https://pactus.org) PAC coins to every other well-known blockchain out there using a wPAC Token.

## Reason that we made that

In [PAC Zone](https://github.com/PACZone) (powered by [Dezh](https://dezh.tech)), we decided to design and implement this protocol over Pactus to unleash the power of PAC on DeFi and ...

## Future Vision

Currently Teleport it a semi-centralized protocol (half decentralized) since there is no contract support on Pactus. [More details about this are here](#how-it-works).

#### Our RoadMap

1. We will add [wPAC](https://github.com/PACZone/TeleWrapped) to More blockchains such as Solana, TON, Aptos and ... [ ]
2. The main plan is to make this protocol 100% decentralized and trust-less using multi-signature cryptography (Teleport Protocol V2). [ ]
3. We have plan to update the protocol and use Pactus contracts (still decentralized and trust-less but using contracts) in 2025 Q1 once contracts was available on Pactus (Teleport Protocol V3). [ ]
4. After contract support on Pactu chain we will add wrapped of other coins on Pactus too(Teleport Protocol V3). [ ]

All V1(semi-centralized), V2(decentralizes using multi-signature) and V3(decentralizes smart-contract) [Wrapped Tokens](https://github.com/PACZone/TeleWrapped) minted on different networks, will be compatible on Teleport.
